# d2l-epochs - My 
This repo tracks my progress thorugh the [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) book. 

📌 Why This Repo?
  - To document my understanding of each chapter i.e major "aha" moments or connections made with prior chapters
  - To experiment with PyTorch implementations provided in the book
  - To build mini-projects showcasing my learning


📅 Planned Timeline
I'm following a slow & steady pace, balancing this with university and German studies.
